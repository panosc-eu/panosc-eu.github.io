The Photon and Neutron Open Science Cloud (PaNOSC) is a Europen project (finaced by the [INFRAEOSC-04](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/infraeosc-04-2018.html) call) for making [FAIR](https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples) data a reality in 6 [ESFRI](http://www.esfri.eu/) Research Infrastructures (RIs), developing and providing services for scientific data and connecting these to the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC).

## Kickoff meeting

The kickoff meeting for PanOSC will take place on the 15+16 January at the ESRF on the EPN Campus. Details of the agenda and meeting can be found here:

[https://indico.esrf.fr/indico/event/19/](https://indico.esrf.fr/indico/event/19/)

Anyone who is interested is welcome to attend! Registration opens on 3 December 2018.

## Partners
 The 6 ESFRI RIs are:
* [European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF)](http://www.esrf.fr))
* [Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL)](https://www.ill.eu)
* [European X-ray Free Electron Laser Facility (EuXFEL)](https://www.xfel.eu)
* [Extreme Light Infrastructure (ELI)](https://eli-laser.eu)
* [The European Spallation Source ERIC (ESS)](https://www.esss.se)
* [The Central European Research Infrastructure Consortium (CERIC-ERIC)](https://www.ceric-eric.eu)

The 7th partner is the e-infrastructure
* [The European Grid Infrastructure Foundation (EGI)](https://www.egi.eu)

PaNOSC is coordinated by the ESRF.

The project will work closely with the national photon and neutron sources to develop common policies, strategies and solutions in the area of data management and data services and connecting to the EOSC.

## Objectives
* Participate in the construction of the EOSC by linking with the e-infrastructures and other ESFRI clusters.
* Make scientific data produced at Europeâ€™s major Photon and Neutron sources fully compatible with the FAIR principles.
* Generalise the adoption of open data policies, standard metadata and data stewardship from 15 photon and neutron RIs and physics institutes across Europe
* Provide innovative data services to the users of these facilities locally and the scientific community at large via the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC).
* Increase the impact of RIs by ensuring data from user experiments can be used beyond the initial scope.
* Share the outcomes with the national RIs who are observers in the proposal and the community at large to promote the adoption of FAIR data principles, data stewardship and the EOSC.

## The PaNOSC proposal
The PaNOSC proposal was submitted on March 20. 2018 in response to the EU Horizon2020 Call for Proposals [INFRAEOSC-04-2018](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/infraeosc-04-2018.html). The proposal is public and can be found here (TBC).
